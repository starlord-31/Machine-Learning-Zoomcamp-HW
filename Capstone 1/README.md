Problem Description: Predicting FIFA 24 Football Player Values

In this project, the aim is to develop a machine learning model to predict the estimated value of FIFA football players. Using a dataset rich in player attributes, including demographics, physical traits, and performance metrics, the goal is to explore, clean, and preprocess the data. The focus is on experimenting with various machine learning models, selecting the most effective one for predicting player values. The end objective is to provide a useful tool for gamers, allowing them to estimate the in-game value of players based on their characteristics and skills.
